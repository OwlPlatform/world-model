Setting up MYSQL for the World Model
====================================

In order to use to the msyql world model, you must of course first have mysql or MariaDB set up. On Slackware (and possibly other linux distributions):

1. Install the tables required to run mysql for the first time:
   sudo mysql_install_db
2. Start mysql
   bash /etc/rc.d/rc.mysqld start
   You should also make this script executable with the chmod command to allow mysql to start automatically when your computer restarts. To speed up your mysql database you may wish to drop some ACID compliance by putting this command in your mysql configuration:
     innodb-flush-log-at-trx-commit = 2
3. Configure passwords and such to secure your databases.
   sudo mysql_secure_installation
4. Create a user for the system. An example of the commands to run appears in scripts/setup-mysql.txt
